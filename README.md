# Personal Portfolio

## Description:
This is my budding portfolio. I have divided it into 3 sections, **Home, Projects, Blogs.** I will be uploading all my projects, blogs and information on this website with both **Live Project** and
**Source Code** link. It also hosts link to my **Github, LinkedIn and Twitter**.

### Technologies Used:
1) HTML.
2) CSS
***
**Brief:** This is my budding **portfolio.** I have added **hover effects** on navbar as well as buttons.

#### What Next?
Well, I am planning to use **JavaScript** and added side toggle menu for smaller screens. Also I intend to add **resume** and active pages.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features together._
